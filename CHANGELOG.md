## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Session 1 COMBINED ANALYSIS cell no longer fails with `NameError: name 'df_patients' is not defined` when the PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS TABLE cell is skipped. The cell now rebuilds `df_patients` from the `patients` list directly, making it self-contained. Applied to all four Session 1 notebooks: `session1_student.ipynb`, `session1_instructor.ipynb`, `session1_backup.ipynb`, `session1_backup_instructor.ipynb`.
- Session 3 ADD SESSION 3 TOOLS cell no longer fails with `NameError: name 'tools' is not defined` when the TOOL SCHEMAS cell is skipped. The cell now initializes the base 3 tool schemas and `available_functions` dict before extending with the 3 Session 3 tools, making it self-contained. Applied to `session3_student.ipynb` and `session3_instructor.ipynb`.
